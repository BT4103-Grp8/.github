# Welcome to Team 8's Business Analytics Capstone Project ðŸ‘‹

# Introduction
The project is **Gen AI for Prospect Information Report** for **Marsh** which aims to use generative AI and other possible technologies to automate the production of elementary company reports for brokers in Marsh.
There are currently 5 different repositories listed below:
| Repositories        | Purpose           |
| :-------------: |-------------|
| [user-portal](https://github.com/BT4103-Grp8/user-portal/tree/main) | To start the front-end user portal for the user to start using the web-application |
| [webscraper](https://github.com/BT4103-Grp8/webscraper)| Contains the python code which web scrapes the internet for information of the company keyed into the front-end user portal |
| [pdfparser](https://github.com/BT4103-Grp8/pdfparser) | Contains the python code which parses the 20-F form of the company (if there is one) to push into the AI model |
| [info-extraction](https://github.com/BT4103-Grp8/info-extraction)  | Contains the python code which runs the Generative AI model to answer fixed prompts given to it using the information that has been web scraped and inputted by the user |
| [report-generator](https://github.com/BT4103-Grp8/report-generator) | Contains the python code which formats the front-end user dashboard into a markdown format for the user to download as a PDF file |

# To get started
To get access: Feel free to email longja05@gmail.com to request for access

Step 1: Download the following repositories into local machine
- (https://github.com/BT4103-Grp8/user-portal/tree/main)
- (https://github.com/BT4103-Grp8/info-extraction)
- (https://github.com/BT4103-Grp8/webscraper)
- (https://github.com/BT4103-Grp8/report-generator)
- (https://github.com/BT4103-Grp8/pdfparser)

Step 2: Order of project execution
1) webscraper-main
2) pdfparser-main
3) info-extraction-main
4) report-generator-main [Use report-generator-integration-google-cloud for google cloud setup]
5) user-portal-main [Use user-portal-local-dev for local setup]

# Additional Notes

## Difference between user-portal branches
user-portal-main: Uses google cloud functions for web-scraper and info-extraction (without Dolly)
user-portal-local-dev: Uses server.py to run all 4 python scripts

For local setup, use user-portal-local-dev branch, server.py file has all the scripts that needs to be customised before execution.

## Difference between report-generator branches
report-generator-main: works with user-portal-main
report-generator-integration-google-cloud: edited to work as a google cloud function but still facing some issues which can be resolved by using another library (instead of pyhtml2pdf) to convert the html to pdf which does not download the pdf locally.
